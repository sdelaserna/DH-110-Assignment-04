# DH 110 Assignment 04 Persona + Usage Scenario

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
> The purpose of UX storytelling is for the designer to put themselves in the shoes and viewpoint of their user and how they would interact with the product, or in this case, a website. The first step is to create a persona, like creating an in-game character model, but it’s based off of the user research conducted early (usability testing or contextual inquiries). There would be multiple personas with different goals, motivations, and/or needs, but interacting with the same product. Hopefully, this would uncover more flaws on the design before finalization so it can be improved. Creating a story from beginning to end will allow for a smooth process for both the user and the system and therefore create a better product.

### Elaina's Scenario
> Feature 1: Map to locate nearest food closet with dates and times + easily adds on to her calendar
> Personal story posts with pictures of how the food pantry positively impacted them! 

#### Elaina just finished up her morning shift at the daycare center near College of the Desert campus after saying a sweet goodbye to her child. She is now going to her Developmental Psychology class in the afternoon. She did a double take to her right. On the announcement board , a flyer says,”FOOD DRIVE TODAY! on campus” but with yesterday’s date. Elaina sighs in disappointment. She’s been so busy lately that she has not gone to the grocery store in over a week and is now relying on whatever is left in her pantry. The food drive would have been perfect to fit in her schedule if it was today. She sees at the bottom of the flyer, “For more information visit collegeofthedesert.edu!” Elaina had some minutes to kill before class, so she thought why not go to the link. She’s grasping for any opportunity at this point to save herself the stress of spending more time, money, and energy even if it’s a basic necessity. Elaina wants to ask for help even though it makes her uncomfortable since she believes that other people are more in need than her. Perhaps, she’s even a little prideful that she was able to get this far as a a single mother with minimal help. She has never been to a food pantry before and does not have any idea what it will be like either. She tried googling this before, but she finds the websites intimidating. 
 
#### When Elaina gets to the food pantry page, she sees a map of all the food pantries, food drives, and soup kitchens in the Coachella Valley! All the little landmark icons would expand with more details when the mouse is over it like the link to the organization hosting the event, with date and time. Above this map, there is a filter option for the closest one available and time that best suits the food service to the user. There is a calendar icon with a plus at the top right corner (which says add to calendar when the mouse is hovering it) and it easily adds to calendar that is connected to the personal device. It was now super easy to see which food service around her or on campus would fit into her busy schedule! She found out the food pantry is still available on campus too at the Student Activities Center! (Just no fresh vegetables.)

#### The feature that connects with Elaina the most is that there are personal stories of how the food pantry at College of the Desert positively impacted their lives. She saw that people of all ages and statuses were taking part in this community resource whether it was volunteering, donating, or using the service. There were pictures and direct quotes from these people! She felt reassured and knew that she was in good hands. Elaina even saw a similar story to her situation and wants to reach out to that person. She learned that it really doesn’t hurt to ask. She decided to muster up the courage when her Developmental Psychology class is over to go to the Student Activities Center and check out what’s available for her to take home.

### Jacob's Scenario
> Feature 2:  Real time food stock updated online and ability to reserve 4 items 
#### Jacob has only been at College of the Desert for a semester and is getting back into the rhythm of school. He just had a long restful winter break filled with cooking, baking, and taking care of his younger siblings by driving them to school, to their extracurricular activities, and back home. He had done more freelancing work during that time and was able to buy Christmas presents for his family and take them out for deserts after their sports practice. 

However, recently the gas prices and rent has increased more than their family has predicted. They have savings, but the family really does not want to touch it because funds are supposed to be the down payment for a house. The parents thought of reducing or completely cutting off the youngest sibling’s extracurricular activities, but Jacob is extremely opposed to that because he knows how happy swimming makes the youngest feel and he has a talent in cxompetitive swimming already. He promised that he could find other ways to save on money to his parents.

He looked onto google for coupon apps and food drives and he did attend a few in his area during winter break. However, he sometimes would show up and did not see what he needed in terms of food. Now that he’s back in school along with his part time tutoring job at the writing center, it’s tough to go back to that specific food drive without wasting too much time. He overheard from his co-workers that there was a food pantry available on campus. They were about to go into details about it, but his boss requested him to do a task right then.

Jacob decided to check online to learn about the details of time, date, and location. He worries a little about being seen at the food pantry by his friends since he hasn’t opened up to them about his struggles just yet. As Jacob navigates through the pages, he finds that there is a feature where there are real time updates on the food stock available. It can come in different categories like type of food: breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It can also be tagged by the macros such as carbs, protein, fiber, oils, and etc. The food item gets as specific as the actual name! And there is even an ability to reserve up to 4 items with a prompt below the item using his school login and ID. With this, Jacob doesn’t necessarily have to go to the food pantry without a doubt in his mind that a food item he wants is not there! He now plans to check this page out tomorrow morning. He wishes that more food services would adopt this, but also realizes that the non-profit organizations are probably at max capacity just sustaining the services that they have available.
